# Crypto-Clustering
Challenge 19

This activity involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means and optimizing the clustering process with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

First step is: File Setup and Data Preparation
Second step is: Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters (k)
Third step is: Cluster Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
Forth step is: Optimize Clustering with PCA
Fifth step is: Cluster Cryptocurrencies Using PCA Data

Determine optimal clusters for cryptocurrencies.
Compare clustering performance with and without PCA.
Gain insights into the effects of dimensionality reduction on K-means clustering.
